  - instagram_business_basic
  - instagram_business_manage_messages
  - instagram_business_manage_comments

Implementation Status:
- The backend/services/instagramService.js file has been updated to use these exact scopes and the 'www.instagram.com' endpoint.
- The Redirect URI in the code is currently dynamic (based on where the server runs, e.g., localhost or production).
- If deploying to akgsempire.org, ensure the server is accessible at that domain for the callback to work.
